excerpt: Technical blogging is a great way to share your expertise while building a potentially valuable readership. It can help you to document projects, or provide guidance to other web users. You can also monetize your content, or use your blog to market your services.

While technical blogs have the same general characteristics as non-technical blogs, refining your blogging technique will help to make the technical content of your blogs more accessible.
