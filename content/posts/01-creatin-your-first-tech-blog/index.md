# It's all about javascript
## Getting started with DOM...

As we all know what is *"Document"*?. Document is nothing as we all know its just like a file whenever you say you know that its a file , it can be a excel file , it can be an HTML file or it can be any file so , thats basically your document.But in the context of DOM we usually talk about HTML document here.

so lets talk about what is "*object*" in that DOM(Document object model).Object is anything that you put inside this HTML document,so HTML tag is an object,your body tag ,head tag,title tag,button tag everything is an object and "*Model*" is how you layout all of these structure.

so DOM can add dynamic content to the web page .It represent the HTML document ,its a root element and it has properties and methods.
